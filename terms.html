        <div class="container" style="max-width: 800px;">
            <h1 style="margin-bottom: 40px;">Terms and Conditions of Ascend Roofing Group Pty Ltd</h1>

            <div class="terms-content">
                <h2>Acceptance of Orders</h2>
                <p>Ascend Roofing Group Pty Ltd will only be bound by orders that have been formally accepted in
                    writing.</p>

                <h2>Quotation Validity</h2>
                <p>All quotes provided are valid for a period of sixty (60) days. Our terms of trade require payment
                    within 14 days of invoicing. Quotes are based on N3 wind loading specifications. All of our roofing
                    quotes are classed as our contracts, and once agreed/accepted, they become a binding agreement
                    between ourselves and the client.</p>

                <h2>Installation Notice</h2>
                <p>To schedule your installation, please provide a minimum notice of 1 to 4 weeks prior to the site
                    measurement. This allows Ascend Roofing Group adequate time to arrange contractors and scaffolding.
                    Our quotations are based on the completion of work as outlined in the scope. If site conditions
                    necessitate a change in the work plan, we reserve the right to reassess our pricing.</p>

                <h2>Safety Requirements</h2>
                <p>Safety battens are mandatory for rafters exceeding 600mm.</p>

                <h2>Exclusions</h2>
                <p>Please note that our quotes do not include Hoods, Skylights, Brick Flashings, or Rainwater Heads;
                    however, these can be arranged upon request.</p>

                <h2>Access and Safety</h2>
                <p>It is essential to ensure adequate access to the job site. Insufficient access may lead to delays.
                    Scaffolding and edge protection are required for any work conducted at heights above 2 meters, roofs
                    with a pitch greater than 26 degrees, or within 1.5 meters from a boundary. These will be provided
                    by the builder or client unless otherwise specified in the quote.</p>

                <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                <p>By approving your quote, you agree to the terms and conditions of Ascend Roofing Group Pty Ltd. You
                    authorize us to proceed with the work as detailed in the quote and agree to pay the full amount upon
                    job completion. A 10% deposit is required to initiate the project, along with any agreed-upon
                    progress payments. All other charges must be settled on the day of completion unless otherwise
                    stated on the invoice.</p>

                <h2>Site Preparation</h2>
                <p>It is the responsibility of the customer to clear the work area of all vehicles, outdoor furniture,
                    and other items prior to the commencement of work. While Ascend Roofing Group will exercise care, we
                    cannot be held liable for damages if the area is not adequately prepared. For safety reasons, all
                    pets, children, and adults must maintain a safe distance from the work area while work is in
                    progress. Please be aware that extreme weather conditions may cause delays in the start of work or
                    hinder specific tasks.</p>

                <h2>Pre Existing Conditions</h2>
                <p>It is the client’s responsibility to inform us of any known leaks or water damage that are present
                    prior to the start of our work. Existing conditions already there prior are not Ascend Roofing
                    Group's responsibility and will fall back onto the client. Complete framing of the home must be in
                    place prior to Ascend Roofing Group coming to install your roof.</p>

                <h2>Liability</h2>
                <p>We strive to provide high-quality roofing installation services. However, should a leak occur during
                    the installation process, we will take immediate action to tarp the affected area. It is important
                    to understand that while we will do our best to mitigate any leaks, we cannot guarantee that the
                    roof will remain leak-free until the installation is fully completed. Our liability for leaks during
                    the installation is limited to the efforts made to tarp the area and provide temporary protection.
                    We will not be held liable for any damages resulting from leaks that occur during the installation
                    process, nor for any leaks that existed prior to our work.</p>

                <h2>Communication</h2>
                <p>Disrespectful behaviour, insults, threats, or any form of harassment towards our staff will not be
                    tolerated and may result in Ascend Roofing Group cancelling your quote or contract at any time and
                    you will be liable for any outstanding payments for materials ordered or works completed. We will
                    communicate any changes to the original timeframe as soon as possible. Clients will be informed of
                    any significant delays and the reasons behind them.</p>

                <h2>Timeframe</h2>
                <p>All job completion timeframes provided are estimates and are subject to change. We strive to meet the
                    projected timelines but cannot guarantee exact completion dates. Adverse weather conditions may
                    affect the progress of work. Delays caused by rain, snow, wind, or extreme temperatures may result
                    in extended completion times. The timely arrival of materials is crucial for project completion.
                    Delays in material orders, whether due to supplier issues or other unforeseen circumstances, may
                    impact the overall job timeframe. Certain projects may require approvals from builders or
                    contractors. Delays in obtaining necessary permits or approvals may result in changes to the
                    estimated completion date. We appreciate your flexibility and understanding regarding potential
                    changes to job timeframes. Our team is committed to completing the work as efficiently as possible
                    while maintaining quality standards.</p>

                <h2>Warranty Information</h2>
                <p>The warranty provided by Ascend Roofing Group is between us and the customer named in the quote. We
                    offer a 10-year warranty on our workmanship, alongside any product warranty from the manufacturer.
                    Roof restorations are warranted only on roofs originally restored by Ascend Roofing Group. This
                    warranty does not cover damage resulting from normal wear and tear or exposure to harsh conditions,
                    such as erosion from salt or sandblasting in coastal or arid regions. Once the installation is fully
                    completed, we provide a warranty for our work, which includes a guarantee against leaks under normal
                    conditions. We encourage clients to thoroughly inspect the completed work and report any concerns
                    immediately. All materials brought onto the site remain the property of Ascend Roofing Group until
                    full payment is received. Upon completion of the job, Ascend Roofing Group is not liable for any
                    damages caused by the customer or other tradespeople.</p>

                <h2>Cooling-Off Period</h2>
                <p>Customers have a 7-day cooling-off period during which they may cancel the contracted quote. Should
                    the contract/quote be canceled after this period, the customer will be liable for any materials
                    ordered and labor performed.</p>

                <h2>Right to Cancel</h2>
                <p>Ascend Roofing Group reserves the right to cancel the contract at any time due to unforeseen
                    circumstances or if you breach the Terms and Conditions set out above. We will not tolerate threats
                    of negative feedback or any form of harassment. Any such behaviour may result in legal action if
                    mediation is not able to be reached.</p>
